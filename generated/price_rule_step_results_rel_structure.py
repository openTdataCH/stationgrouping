        calculation, e.g. an additional tax step. If PRICING RULES are
        chained there may be multiple steps to record. The source of the
        input price can be indicated by a FARE PRICE REF of some sort.
        The RULE STEP RESULT Amount is the resulting  net price after
        the pricing rule has been applied to the input amount. The RULE
        STEP RESULT  Adjustment Amount is  the difference beteen the
        original input price and the RULE STEP RESULT  Amount (so it is

        Adjustment to the  Net Amount.  A similar computation can be
